## PixeLAW: Autonomous Pixel Playground

[PixeLAW](https://www.pixelaw.xyz/) is an anutonomous pixel playground, there are two implementations, [one](https://dojo.pixelaw.xyz/) is built using [Cairo](https://book.cairo-lang.org/) and [Dojo](https://book.dojoengine.org/) on top of [Starknet](https://book.starknet.io/), [another](https://mud.pixelaw.xyz/) is built using [Solidity](https://soliditylang.org/) and [MUD](https://mud.dev/) on top of [Redstone](https://redstone.xyz/). [PixeLAW](https://www.pixelaw.xyz/) has a core layer so that builders can create their own applications top of it. These apps share states and interact each other.

This book is dedicated to familiarizing you with PixeLAW and its [vision](https://medium.com/@syora/discovering-pixelaw-the-fully-onchain-planet-ac5e8bb40dfb) to create an [autonomous world](https://book.dojoengine.org/theory/autonomous-worlds.html).
